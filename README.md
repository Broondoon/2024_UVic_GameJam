# 2024 UVic Game Jam
A solo dev project for the 2024 UVic Game Dev Club's very own game jam!

## Work Log
The game jam is either 48 or 72 hours long, spread out across an entire week. Given reading break has a lot of expectations and assignments and midterms immediately after, I'll be splitting up my work time into smaller chunks than simple day-long periods. The only way I can participate is by chipping away at my submission in between working on other things. A litte stressful, so we'll see how it goes!

**Current Progress:**
- Feb 18
  - Hour 1 [3:00pm]: GitHub repo creation, Godot project creation, theme reveal and project planning
  - Hour 2 [5:00pm]: Basic tutorials (UI, text features)
- Feb 19
  - Hour 3/4 [10am - 12pm]: Mask shader tutorial, UI container stuff, more planning
 
Hours remaining: [47] [71]
