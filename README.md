# 2024 UVic Game Jam
A solo dev project for the 2024 UVic Game Dev Club's very own game jam!

## Work Log
The game jam is either 48 or 72 hours long, spread out across an entire week. Given reading break has a lot of expectations and assignments and midterms immediately after, I'll be splitting up my work time into smaller chunks than simple day-long periods. The only way I can participate is by chipping away at my submission in between working on other things. A litte stressful, so we'll see how it goes!

**Current Progress:**
- Feb 18
  - Hour 1 [3:00pm]: GitHub repo creation, Godot project creation, theme reveal and project planning
  - Hour 2 [5:00pm]: Basic tutorials (UI, text features)
- Feb 19
  - Hour 3/4 [10am - 12pm]: Mask shader tutorial, UI container stuff, more planning

Now it was at this point in which the looming shadows of the proverbial guillotines that were my exam and midterm deadlines became too much. I realized that I really shouldn't be doing a game jam with such heavy projects requiring my attention. I had to capitulate to their demands! So I did not finish the game jam unfortuately.

Although I still really like the concept and what I was working towards, so I'll still treat this as a pseudo game jam. I'll continue to log my hours, putting in work when I can, and stopping once I've hit the limit.

- Feb 28/29
  - Hour 5 [6pm ~ 6:30pm, 12:30pm ~ 1pm]: UI asset creation (looks bad lol, but I like it), more messing with UI layout, things starting to visually come together.
 
Hours remaining: [43] [67]
